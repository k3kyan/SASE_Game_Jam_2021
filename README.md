# SASE Game Jam 2021
This is my submission for the SASE 2021 National Game Jam where my team won. I coded all of the project while my team worked on the development and concept. 

This project was developed in between September 30 to October 3, 2021. However, I uploaded the project to GitHub in 2023 with some cleanup in the code files.

## Notes on playing the game:
The game .exe file can be found in the `BUILD` Folder. When playing, wait for the dialogue to fully load before clicking or pressing any button. Otherwise, the text will stay and stack up on top of each other.
